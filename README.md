# Form Validation

This is a contact form that includes fields for the first name, last name, email, and message. The validation checks that all fields are filled out and ensures that the email address is in a valid format. The name fields (first and last) are verified to contain only letters, while the message field checks that it contains a reasonable number of characters. This validation ensures that users provide the necessary information correctly before the form is submitted.
